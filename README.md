<h1>🤔 Why ?</h1>

<p>I am 19 y/o and have been into computers ever since I was ~10, growing up, I always thought about how software could do anything someone could dream of, so I started learning multiple languages until stepping upon Kotlin. Since then, I've learnt and started to build Android apps, and CuteCalc is my first project upon, I hope, alot more. </p>
